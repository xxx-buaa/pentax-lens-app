RICOH states that this will minimize chromatic aberration and prevent color bleeding, not only in the main in-focus area, but also in the surrounding defocused areas. It also features a large-aperture negative meniscus optical element, a biconvex aspherical glass-mold optical element, and a high-refraction glass optical element in the first lens group, to reduce overall size despite its ultra-wide-angle design. RICOH claims that this lens will deliver outstanding imaging performance for sharp, crisp images without any fuzziness, even in peripheral areas. Stay tuned for our upcoming test of the D FA 21mm lens which will look into these claims. * Cameras compatible with this system are the K-50 and newer. For K-1, K-3 II, K-3, K-S2, K-S1 and K-50, the cameras firmware must be upgraded to the latest version. If this lens is mounted on a camera without proper firmware upgrade, its diaphragm control mechanism becomes inactive leaving the aperture fixed at F2.4, making it difficult to obtain correct exposure."

The center is less soft than the edges. The effect is most pronounced in the range F2.8 to F5.6. From F2.8 to F6.7 the aperture closes down manually to the value set with the aperture ring. Av exposure mode can be used from F2.8 to F5.6. At F6.7 the exposure mode switches to M even if set to Av and an exposure error occurs. When the aperture ring is turned further toward F32 the aperture blades remain at F6.7 and the lens doesn't stop down to the set value until the exposure is made or the optical preview is engaged.

Initially this lens was produced using a slightly lighter optical formula employing an Aspherical Element (AL). This version was quickly taken out of production by Pentax, probably due to cost of manufacturing, and only few of these lenses exist today. The spherical version of this lens came in two optically identical variants, but with different engraved names: SMC PENTAX 1:3.5/15 (early variant) or smc PENTAX 1:3.5 15mm (later variant)"

At the time, its wide F1.4 aperture made it the fastest 20mm lens of its kind. Despite this, the lens managed to be quite compact with barrel dimensions of just 80mm long x 65mm wide. It is also rumored that despite Asahi's exploration of aspherical lens designs at the time (such as in prototype version of the 15mm F3.5), this 20mm has an optical formula based solely on spherical elements. This 20mm is among the rarest Pentax K-mount lenses in existence, as it was never commercially produced. Only seven prototypes (each slightly different optically) are said to have been produced.

Many other resources also refer to this lens as Super-Takumar. One might think that there are three variants: Takumar, Super-, amd Super-Multi-Coated, but that is not the case per our research. There are only the above mentioned two variants with the first being referred to under two names. The first variant is worthy of the Super designation, though, since it has the auto-aperture feature. The Super-Multi-Coated version supports open aperture metering with the Spotmatic F, ES and ES II, and therefore might as well have been labeled SMC Takumar."

This was meant as a Planar-killer and once its crown had been awarded by the press the simplified 7/6 version was quietly ushered in (before the 8/6 crippled Asahi's finances). This 8 element version can be identified on the location of the infrared focus mark: The mark is to the right of the numeral 4 on the DOF scale. This is nicely illustrated in the second image above. This 8 element version can also be identified on the slightly protruding rear lens element and on the stop down switch, which is marked A M (rather than Auto Man as on the later versions).

On the 645D its field of view is that of a standard lens; on a 645 film camera it will be a wide angle lens. According to PENTAX this lens offers exceptional image-resolving power with outstanding brightness levels even at the edges, while compensating various aberrations to a minimum. All lens characteristics are optimized for digital photography: for instance, flare and ghost images are minimized by applying exclusive lens coatings to optical elements and employing anti-reflection materials for the interior of the lens barrel. As the result, this lens can bring out the full potential of the PENTAX 645D medium-format digital SLR camera. The lens covers the full 645 format and can thus be used on 645 film cameras as well as on 645 digital cameras. The lens has a built-in motor (SDM) for the autofocus function.
