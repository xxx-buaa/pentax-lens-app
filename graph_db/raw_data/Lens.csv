When this lens auto-focuses, the external focusing ring does not move, allowing for comfortable holding and fine manual adjustment on the fly as well as for excellent AF speed. The lens also features an aspherical element, internal focusing, and extra-low dispersion element, and weather sealing to compliment the weather sealing of the K-5. The aperture blades are rounded to help render a very smooth bokeh. Finally, the lens hood also features a filter window for easy use of CPL filters. Note: this lens uses the KAF3 mount.

Other features are Quick Shift and a zoom lock button intended to prevent the zoom from extending when pointed downwards. The lens has a built-in SDM (Supersonic Direct-drive motor) autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Autofocus is thus neither possible with the K100D/K110D or *istD series cameras nor with film SLR cameras. As per RICOH the SDM autofocus motor is of a new generation. Hopefully this means that it is more reliable than the SDM motors introduced back in 2007.

The lens can also be used on DSLRs with an APS-C size sensor; here the field of view goes from standard lens to telephoto. The lens features nine rounded diaphragm blades for smooth Bokeh and it has a number of seals making it weather resistant.

The lens has a built-in DC autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Autofocus is thus available only with the K10D and K100D Super, and all newer cameras. The lens has no aperture ring and is primarily intended for use on DSLR cameras. It can be used, though, on film cameras that have P and Tv automation or where the aperture can be controlled by an e-dial. On film cameras focusing is manual only.
