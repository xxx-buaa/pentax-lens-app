1,K,"The first generation of Pentax K-mount lenses. Officially not referred to as K series lenses, they usually are given this designation to distinguish them from later K-mount lenses (such as the M, A, F, FA and DA series). These were exclusively manual focus lenses with no electronic features. The name of each lens started with an upper case ""SMC"" for the earlier versions and the lower case ""smc"" for the later versions. For example SMC/smc Pentax 28mm F3.5, where SMC/smc stands for Super-Multi-Coated, the lens coating introduced in the early 1970s at the end of the M42-mount era."
2,M,"The M series of lenses followed on from the earlier K series lenses. As with the earlier lenses, these were manual K-mount lenses without any electronic features. They behave just like the K series but are generally smaller in size, to match the more compact bodies of the same era, e.g. the Pentax MX and the Pentax ME Super."
3,A,"Another K-mount lens, the A series of lenses saw the introduction of ""automatic"" aperture settings. The lenses had an aperture ring (unlike the later DA series), and thus the aperture could be set manually, but they also had an ""A"" mode, which allowed the camera to control the aperture automatically."
4,F,"The F series were the first autofocus lenses (excluding the rare smc Pentax-AF 35-70mm F2.8, made only for the ME-F camera). The autofocus is of screw-drive type, still supported by all Pentax DSLRs. They featured an aperture ring, which allowed the aperture to be controlled manually. Thus F lenses are able to be used on older cameras which do not support automatic setting of the aperture, such as the Pentax K1000."
5,FA,"These lenses are designed with use for full-frame film SLR cameras. As with the F series, they feature an aperture ring providing compatibility with older camera bodies. Autofocus is like the F series of screw-drive type. The FA* lenses are professional grade lenses and the FA Limited lenses are all metal high quality primes. The FA series has been superseded by the DA and D FA series optimized for digital cameras, but as of March 2017 the three FA limited as well as the FA 35 mm f2 and 50 mm f1.4 are still in production."
6,D FA,"These lenses are coated with glazes that make the lenses more suitable for digital cameras. However, they also support older 35mm camera formats, as they provide full frame coverage. The series originally consisted only of two macro lenses – a 50mm and a 100mm – which both featured an aperture ring. In 2009 the 100mm was replaced by a weather resistant (WR) version without an aperture ring, that was co-developed with Tokina. The series was revived in February 2015 when the D FA* 70-200mm f2.8 and D FA 150-450mm f4.5-5.6 telephoto zoom lenses were announced along with first pictures of a (then unnamed) K-1 mock-up."
7,DA,"The DA lenses were designed specifically for the Pentax digital cameras incorporating an APS-C digital sensor. As the APS-C sensor has a smaller surface area than 35mm film, these lenses are not generally considered to be compatible with older cameras. They also lack an aperture ring, limiting their use on cameras that do not support automatic aperture settings. Most of the DA zoom lenses are available in weather resistant (WR) versions to match the weather sealed capabilities of the medium to upper level Pentax DSLR camera bodies. While older models still have the in-body screw drive autofocus system, newer designs marked ""DC"", ""SDM"" or ""PLM"" feature silent, in-lens autofocus motors.Some lenses of this product line such as the DA 10-17 Fisheye were co-developed with Tokina."
8,M42 Screwmount,"These classic manual focus lenses are wonderful because they can be adapted to any Pentax DSLR, as well as SLRs made by other manufacturers such as Canon and Nikon."
9,645,"SMC Pentax 645 Lenses are medium-format lenses that can be used on Pentax 645 bodies, as well as on Pentax K-mount bodies with the appropriate adapter."
10,67,Larger lenses designed for the 6x7 system
11,M37 Screwmount,The oldest Pentax lenses
12,Auto 110,Tiny lenses for the Auto 110 mini-SLR
13,Q,"Pentax Q-Mount lenses are very small and designed exclusively for use with the Pentax Q compact mirrorless camera.There are currently two main Q lens lines: ""Performance"" lenses, including the 01 prime and 02 zoom, and ""Creative"" lenses, which include the 03 fisheye and 04/05 wide and tele toy lenses."
