11,description,"The SMC Pentax-DA 50mm F1.8 lens is designed for the APS-C sensor format and performs like a small telephoto lens in that format (75mm eqv.). Pentax promises a superb rendition of depth and a natural bokeh (out-of-focus) effect in part thanks to the rounded aperture blades. It features a lightweight plastic construction with a plastic lens mount similar to that of the DA 35mm F2.4. The large maximum aperture of F1.8 produces a shallow depth of field which is ideal for portrait photography. The front element is SP coated so as to repel dirt and grease and be easier to clean. This lens is an affordable alternative to the DA* 55mm F1.4 lens. It will cost $249 and be available in late June / early July, 2012. It has a plastic bayonet."

17,description,"The HD PENTAX-DA 560mm F5.6 ED AW DC extreme telephoto lens was initially announced at the CP+ tradeshow in February, 2012 and officially announced in September, 2012 at Photokina. It went on sale in February, 2013. This lens is designed for the APS-C sensor format. With a modest maximum aperture of 5.6 it is relatively affordable and convenient to carry around. The lens is optimized for rendering distant subjects particularly sharp and well-defined. The DA 560mm is based on optics used in astronomical telescopes. Contrary to popular belief, the lens is not collapsible (it does feature a built-in retractable hood, however). The lens is designed for all-weather use (AW) incorporating a total of 29 seals to protect the innards of the lens. It has a built-in filter holder at the rear taking 40.5mm filters. A circular polarizer filter which can be rotated without removing the filter from the lens is included with the lens. The lens has a built-in DC autofocus motor and features Quick-shift which allows the photographer to manually fine tune focus without switching out of autofocus mode.. On cameras with no support for in-lens autofocus motors (*istD series, K100D and K110D) the lens works as a manual focus lens. This lens features Pentax HD coating, the next generation of multi-coating (supersedes SMC coating). The diaphragm blades are rounded for a smooth bokeh in the range F5.6 to F11. The filter holder at the rear has a wheel that allows for turning the circular polarizer when mounted in the holder."

20,description,"This is a high end ultra-wide angle zoom lens for the APS-C format with a large maximum aperture for a wide angle zoom of F2.8. It complements the DA* 16-50mm F2.8 and DA* 50-135mm lenses as a weather sealed trio of F2.8 high performance lenses for the APS-C format. The 11-18mm zoom is weather sealed and features a focus clamp intended to prevent accidental change of focus e.g. when the lens is used for astro-photography. The lens is cold-resistant to -10 degrees centigrade. The exterior is designed with a lens heater groove to prevent dew condensation. To facilitate the installation of the heater, the lens is shaped fairly level, without a bump between the lens barrel and the focus and zoom rings. The lens barrel has been constructed with metallic components for effective transmission of the heat generated by the heater. Case, caps and lens hood are included with the lens. The lens hood features a removable door which allows for rotating a polarizing filter should one be attached. The lens was released on February 22, 2019."

23,description,"The HD Pentax-DA* 16-50mm F2.8ED PLM SDM AW is a professional APS-C format zoom lens designed to deliver high image quality. It features a PLM autofocus motor which allows for fast and silent autofocus also suitable for autofocus during video recording. The lens mount is KAF4*, which incorporates electromagnetic aperture control and the lens is weather sealed. The lens is rated for use from -10 degrees C to 40 degrees C and a humidity of 85% or less. The lens has three super ED glass lens elements and one anomalous glass element for the purpose of reducing chromatic aberration. This lens replaces the smc Pentax-DA* 16-50mm F2.8ED AL [IF] SDM , vhivh goes all the way back to 2007. Where this old model had internal focus ([IF]), the new model extends slightly when focusing. The lens is scheduled to become available in August 2021. * Cameras compatible with this system are the K-50 and newer. For K-1, K-3 II, K-3, K-S2, K-S1 and K-50, the cameras firmware must be upgraded to the latest version. If this lens is mounted on a camera without proper firmware upgrade, its diaphragm control mechanism becomes inactive leaving the aperture fixed at F2.8, making it difficult to obtain correct exposure."

25,description,The HD Pentax-DA 16-85mm zoom was presented at Photokina 2014 and is expected to ship in November of 2014. This zoom represents an upgrade from the 18-55mm kit lens being wider as well as having a longer reach and adding to that silent autofocus thanks to a built-in DC autofocus motor. The lens is weather resistant.

27,description,"The HD PENTAX-DA 18-50mm F4-5.6 DC WR RE launched in February 2015 was a welcome addition to the 18-50/55 mm range of zoom lenses for the APS-C format with its built-in autofocus motor for silent autofocusing. Focusing manually with the focusing ring engages the AF motor, which takes care of the focusing. This implies that this lens cannot be used on DSLRs without lens power contacts (K100D and older). As a first for Pentax this standard zoom lens is retractable for easy storage and portability. When retracted it measures but 41 mm in length. The lens is weather resistant making it useable in dusty environments or in light rain when paired with a weather-resistant Pentax DSLR. The lens features the Pentax HD coating and super-low dispersion glass elements and aspherical elements for improved image quality. The lens has an smc coated DA L counterpart, which is is included as a kit lens with a camera body and cannot be purchased separately."

31,description,"The SMC Pentax-DA 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 ED AL [IF] DC WR is a new prosumer walkaround lens from Pentax. The lens currently has an MSRP of $499.95 . This lens covers a wide zoom range and features Pentax's latest lens technology, including the Quick-Shift focus system, SP (Super Protect) coating, and a DC motor for the SDM focusing system. When this lens auto-focuses, the external focusing ring does not move, allowing for comfortable holding and fine manual adjustment on the fly as well as for excellent AF speed. The lens also features an aspherical element, internal focusing, and extra-low dispersion element, and weather sealing to compliment the weather sealing of the K-5. The aperture blades are rounded to help render a very smooth bokeh. Finally, the lens hood also features a filter window for easy use of CPL filters. Note: this lens uses the KAF3 mount. Autofocus will only work on SDM-enabled bodies: The K100D Super and K10D (w/ 1.30 firmware or higher) and newer."

39,description,This weather sealed version of the 55-300mm lens was introduced in 2013 with a US MSRP of $449. The original version has been a favorite by many and with most Pentax DSLRs being weather sealed it makes a lot of sense that Pentax introduces it in a WR version. Another upgrade is the lens coating which now is of the more flare resistant HD type. The front element is SP (Super Protect) coated like on the predecessor. SP coating repels grease and finger prints and is easier to clean should it get dirty.

40,description,"The HD Pentax-DA 55-300mm F4.5-6.3 ED PLM WR RE is a compact, weather-sealed APS-C telephoto zoom lens featuring a retractable barrel design. This lens also debuts PLM (Pulse Motor) autofocus technology and an electromagnetic aperture diaphragm to facilitate smooth focusing and exposure adjustments during video recording. Unlike earlier Pentax lenses, the aperture stop-down lever in the camera is not used to control the diaphragm of this lens. A DSLR launched in 2013 or later is needed to operate this new system (the K-500 is not compatible). The optical formula of this lens has been redesigned compared to the previous DA 55-300mm F4-5.8 . The new lens now has a rear-mounted focus ring and internal focus, is nearly 3 cm shorter when collapsed, but also loses about half a stop of light at both ends."

41,description,"Like all current DA lenses, the SMC Pentax DA* 60-250mm is designed only for Pentax DSLR cameras. It was announced in late February, 2007. It auto-focuses with an SDM ultrasonic motor on the K10D (firmware 1.30) and newer cameras. On older cameras the lens will auto-focus with the 'screw drive' mechanism."

42,description,"The smc PENTAX-DA L 18-50mm F4-5.6 DC WR RE kit lens launched in February 2015 was a welcome addition to the selection of kit lenses for the APS-C format due to its built-in autofocus motor for silent autofocusing. Focusing manually with the focusing ring engages the AF motor, which takes care of the focusing. This implies that this lens cannot be used on DSLRs without lens power contacts (K100D and older). As a first for Pentax this standard zoom lens is retractable for easy storage and portability. When retracted it measures but 41 mm in length. The lens is weather resistant making it useable in dusty environments or in light rain when paired with a whether-resistant Pentax DSLR. The lens features super-low dispersion glass elements and aspherical elements for improved image quality. This lens is only sold as a part of a camera/lens kit, and it has an HD coated counter part that is sold separately."

48,description,"The HD Pentax-D FA 21mm F2.4 Limited is the first full-frame Limited lens featuring a built-in silent autofocus motor and weather sealing. It is a premium ultra-wide lens with metal finish in the style of the FA Limited lenses and with an emphasis on top-notch optical performance. The aperture mechanism is controlled electronically (KAF4 mount)*. At 21mm this lens is a nice supplement to the FA limited lenses and to a walk-around zoom like the D FA 28-105mm zoom. Its optics incorporates four ED (Extra-low Dispersion) and one Super ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass optical elements. RICOH states that this will minimize chromatic aberration and prevent color bleeding, not only in the main in-focus area, but also in the surrounding defocused areas. It also features a large-aperture negative meniscus optical element, a biconvex aspherical glass-mold optical element, and a high-refraction glass optical element in the first lens group, to reduce overall size despite its ultra-wide-angle design. RICOH claims that this lens will deliver outstanding imaging performance for sharp, crisp images without any fuzziness, even in peripheral areas. Stay tuned for our upcoming test of the D FA 21mm lens which will look into these claims. * Cameras compatible with this system are the K-50 and newer. For K-1, K-3 II, K-3, K-S2, K-S1 and K-50, the cameras firmware must be upgraded to the latest version. If this lens is mounted on a camera without proper firmware upgrade, its diaphragm control mechanism becomes inactive leaving the aperture fixed at F2.4, making it difficult to obtain correct exposure."

Cosmetics have changed and build quality has been improved - the lens now has an aluminum barrel. This new lens does not have an aperture ring so it is not suitable for use on the older film cameras which do not allow for setting the aperture from the camera body, such as the LX, MX, ME, ME Super, K1000 etc. The aperture has rounded blades which should result in a pleasing and smooth rendering of out-of-focus areas (aka bokeh).

55,description,"The HD Pentax-D FA 15-30mm F2.8 ED SDM WR zoom lens was announced in February 2016. It complements the D FA 24-70mm F2.8 and the D FA* 70-200mm F2.8 zooms so that Pentax users have access to fast F2.8 pro level zoom lenses covering the entire range from 15 mm to 200 mm. On a full frame DSLR the field of view covers that from extreme wide angle to moderate wide angle. The lens can also be used on DSLRs with an APS-C size sensor, but the field of view is much reduced. The HD Pentax-DA* 11-18 mm F2.8 or the smc Pentax-DA 12-24 mm F4 are the better (and lighter) options for APS-C shooters. The 15-30 mm zoom features nine rounded diaphragm blades for smooth Bokeh and it has a number of seals making it weather resistant. The front element is SP coated which helps repel water drops and grease. The lens also features Quick Shift. The lens hood is an integral part of the lens barrel and filters cannot be used due to the massive, protruding front element. The lens has a built-in SDM autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Autofocus is thus available only with the K10D and K100D Super, and all newer cameras. The lens has no aperture ring and is primarily intended for use on DSLR cameras. It can be used, though, on film cameras that have P and Tv automation or where the aperture can be controlled by an e-dial on the camera. On film cameras focusing is manual only. At 1040 g/36.7 oz. this lens is a bit heavy."

56,description,The HD PENTAX-D FA 24-70mm F2.8 ED SDM AW zoom lens was announced in September 2015 as the third zoom lens developed with the Pentax full frame DSLR in mind. On a full frame the field of view covers a very useful range from ultra wide angle to short tele. The lens can also be used on DSLRs with an APS-C size sensor; here the field of view goes from moderate wide angle to telephoto. The lens features rounded diaphragm blades for smooth Bokeh and it has a number of seals making it weather resistant. Other features are Quick Shift and a zoom lock button intended to prevent the zoom from extending when pointed downwards. The lens has a built-in SDM (Supersonic Direct-drive motor) autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Autofocus is thus neither possible with the K100D/K110D or *istD series cameras nor with film SLR cameras. As per RICOH the SDM autofocus motor is of a new generation. Hopefully this means that it is more reliable than the SDM motors introduced back in 2007. The lens is essentially a rebadged Tamron SP 24-70mm F2.8 Di VC USD lens from 2013 with the in-lens stabilization mechanism removed.

57,description,"The HD Pentax-D FA 28-105mm F3.5-5.6 ED DC WR zoom lens was announced in February 2016 as a kit lens for the Pentax K-1 full frame DSLR which was launched at the same time. On a full frame the field of view covers a very useful range for a walk around lens. The lens can also be used on DSLRs with an APS-C size sensor; here the field of view goes from standard lens to telephoto. The lens features nine rounded diaphragm blades for smooth Bokeh and it has a number of seals making it weather resistant. The front element is SP coated which helps repel water drops and grease, Other features are Quick Shift and a ""window"" in the lens hood which makes it easy to rotate a polarizing filter when one is attached. The lens has a built-in DC autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Autofocus is thus available only with the K10D and K100D Super, and all newer cameras. The lens has no aperture ring and is primarily intended for use on DSLR cameras. It can be used, though, on film cameras that have P and Tv automation or where the aperture can be controlled by an e-dial. On film cameras focusing is manual only. At 440 g/15.5 oz the lens is relatively light without being flimsy."

58,description,"The HD PENTAX-D FA* 70-200mm F2.8 ED DC AW telephoto zoom lens was announced at the CP+ tradeshow in February, 2015 preceding the announcement of the K-1 Pentax 24x36mm full-frame DSLR. Together with the HD Pentax 150-450mm extreme telephoto zoom lens these are the first Pentax lenses to cover the 24x36 mm full-frame format since the D FA 100mm F2.8 WR lens, which was introduced back in 2009. While this lens is designed for the 24x36mm full-frame format it can also be used on cameras with the APS-C sensor format. With a respectable maximum aperture of F2.8 and rounded diaphragm blades for smooth Bokeh this zoom can be used as a portrait lens in addition to its more traditional use for sports, wild life and distant landscapes. This lens is pro-grade as indicated by its star designation and also by its feature list: * All-weather protection (AW) * HD coating * SP coating of the front element * Aerobright II nano-coating of the inner elements * Four super-low dispersion elements, two ED elements and two super ED elements with properties like flourite elements * Enhanced Quick-shift function via a three-way switch on the barrel * Focus limiter * Tripod mount The lens hood has the for Pentax traditional removable piece that allows for easy adjustment of an attached polarizing filter. The lens has a built-in DC type autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Autofocus is thus not possible with the K100D/K110D and *istD series cameras. Autofocus is not available with film cameras. In August of 2020 a limited quantity silver version was announced."

59,description,"Introduced in 2020, the HD PENTAX-D FA 70-210mm F4 ED SDM WR is a much lighter option for a telephoto zoom than the HD Pentax-D FA* 70-200mm F2.8 zoom. The new lens weighs in at just 891 g (28.9 oz), whereas the D FA* F2.8 lens weighs in at 1755 g (61.9 oz). To bring the weight down the new lens is one stop slower than the D FA*. While this lens is designed for the 24x36mm full-frame format it can also be used on cameras with the APS-C sensor format. The lens features rounded diaphragm blades for smooth Bokeh and is aimed at shooting sports, wild life and distant landscapes. The key features are: * Weather resistant (WR) * HD coating * SP coating of the front element * Three ED lens elements * Internal focusing and internal zoom * Quick-shift * Focus Range Limiter (0.95cm - 2m and 2m to infinity) The lens has a built-in SDM type autofocus motor and no provision for screw drive autofocus. Furthermore the aperture is electronically controlled, so this lens can only be used with cameras that support the KAF4 mount (K-50 and newer). The lens is compatible with the HD Pentax-DA 1.4x AF Rear Converter when used for the APS-C format. While Pentax does not provide a tripod mount for this lens, the optional A034TM tripod mount made by Tamron for their similar 70-210mm F4 telezoom will fit."

61,description,"The SMC Pentax DA 40mm XS is based on the optical design of the SMC Pentax DA 40mm Limited, but its exterior is designed by Marc Newson so as to match the design of the K-01 mirrorless camera. The lens will work with Pentax DSLRs as well as with the K-01. It is smaller being only 9.2 mm thick. The aperture blades are rounded which produces a smooth bokeh. The front element has SP coating which repels dust, water and grease and which makes it easier to wipe the front element clean. Price: $249 when purchased separately, $149 when purchased in a K-01 kit ."

It has an aperture ring and is therefore fully compatible with all Pentax DSLRs as well as film bodies. It was replaced with the Pentax-D FA* 50mm F1.4 designed specifically for digital cameras with a full frame high-resolution sensor. APS-C shooters have the Pentax-DA* 55mm F1.4 as an alternative.

It is a lightweight consumer walk-around zoom designed for film cameras and it works well on APS-C cameras. It may not be the best choice on a high-resolution full-frame camera due to relatively soft corner sharpness.

104,description,"The pro-grade SMC Pentax-FA* 80-200mm F2.8 ED [IF] is fast for this zoom range. It is quite heavy because of the fast F2.8 maximum aperture and because it employs an all-metal barrel. It includes the Power Zoom feature, which can be taken advantage of on high end Pentax DSLRs as well as select film bodies. This lens also features a tripod collar. You switch between autofocus and manual focus by pushing the focusing forwards (autofocus) or pulling it towards the camera (manual focus). The camera body should be set to autofocus."

109,description,"The FA* 250-600mm is slightly heavier than its F-series due to the addition of power zoom. Rather than having a single ring for focusing and zooming, this lens has a dedicated focusing ring and a dedicated zoom ring, arguably improving its overall handling. This lens takes 43mm filters through a 'drop-in' filter holder near the lens mount. Pentax provided an optional aftermarket circular polarizing filter in a special drop-in holder allowing for the filter to be turned with a dial on the outside, refer the second and third photos. Item number is Pentax 35184 - Circular Polarizing Filter FA*. 112mm filters can be attached to the front. You switch between autofocus and manual focus by pushing the focusing forwards (autofocus) or pulling it towards the camera (manual focus). The camera body should be set to autofocus. Full weight with tripod collar is 5800g."

117,description,"This is a soft focus lens. The degree of softness is controlled with the aperture ring. The effect is most pronounced at F2.8. The center is less soft than the edges. The effect is most pronounced in the range F2.8 to F5.6. From F2.8 to F6.7 the aperture closes down manually to the value set with the aperture ring. Av exposure mode can be used from F2.8 to F5.6. At F6.7 the exposure mode switches to M even if set to Av and an exposure error occurs. When the aperture ring is turned further toward F32 the aperture blades remain at F6.7 and the lens doesn't stop down to the set value until the exposure is made or the optical preview is engaged. In this range (F6.7 to F22) ""green button"" stop down metering in M exposure mode is the way to work with a Pentax DSLR. A Pentax film SLR with aperture simulator will also work in Av mode in this range."

While the standard version had a black barrel, it also came in a special-edition bundle with the LX 2000 with a barrel design resembling that of the current silver FA Limited lenses. The rare LX2000 bundle typically sells for $4000-5000 USD."

182,description,The smallest and slowest of the 50mm standard M lenses. This lens was manufactured over several years. The original version had a metal lens barrel like all other original M lenses. The late version had a plastic lens barrel and was manufactured from parts used in the A version. The aperture on the late version thus closes down linearly with the movement of the stop down lever like on all A lenses.

202,description,"The SMC Pentax 15mm provides the largest rectilinear, full-frame field-of-view ever delivered by a Pentax prime lens. Horizontally, 100 degrees can be captured by this heavy yet relatively compact lens. It features 4 built-in filters since no front filter thread is present. Initially this lens was produced using a slightly lighter optical formula employing an Aspherical Element (AL). This version was quickly taken out of production by Pentax, probably due to cost of manufacturing, and only few of these lenses exist today. The spherical version of this lens came in two optically identical variants, but with different engraved names: SMC PENTAX 1:3.5/15 (early variant) or smc PENTAX 1:3.5 15mm (later variant)"

205,description,"The SMC Pentax 20mm 1:1.4 is an ultra wide-angle lens that was originally exhibited by Asahi at Photokina 1976. At the time, its wide F1.4 aperture made it the fastest 20mm lens of its kind. Despite this, the lens managed to be quite compact with barrel dimensions of just 80mm long x 65mm wide. It is also rumored that despite Asahi's exploration of aspherical lens designs at the time (such as in prototype version of the 15mm F3.5), this 20mm has an optical formula based solely on spherical elements. This 20mm is among the rarest Pentax K-mount lenses in existence, as it was never commercially produced. Only seven prototypes (each slightly different optically) are said to have been produced. An example of one of these prototypesotherwise a fully functional lenssold at auction for $6900 in 2022."

This lens was also marketed as COSMICAR-A 28mm 1:2.8, MC AUTO CPC Phase 2 28mm 1:2.8, and MC AUTO CPC Phase 2 28mm MACRO 1:2.8, the latter presumably with a closer smallest focusing distance than the 30 cm of the other versions.

261,description,"This flat ""pancake"" Fish-Eye-Takumar 17mm F11 lens has fixed focus, a field of view of 180 degrees, and covers the full 24x36mm format. The diaphragm is a perforated disc with perfectly circular openings. This was the first fisheye lens from Pentax, and also the first fisheye lens to become available in M42 mount. The Takumar 17mm F11 was quickly replaced by the 18mm F11 in 1963. We have no official information available from Pentax on this lens so the information presented here is third hand. Some collectors doubt that this lens was ever manufactured. If you have a picture of the lens or official information please contact a forum administrator."

262,description,"This fast fish-eye lens has an image circle that completely covers the 24x36mm full frame format. It features a 180-degree angle of view diagonally. It came in two variants with these engraved names (each pictured above): 1: Fish-Eye-Takumar 1:4/17 2: Super-Multi-Coated FISH-EYE-TAKUMAR 1:4/17 The first variant is referred to as Super-Takumar in Pentax brochures from the time even though the engraved name does not have the word ""Super"" in it. Many other resources also refer to this lens as Super-Takumar. One might think that there are three variants: Takumar, Super-, amd Super-Multi-Coated, but that is not the case per our research. There are only the above mentioned two variants with the first being referred to under two names. The first variant is worthy of the Super designation, though, since it has the auto-aperture feature. The Super-Multi-Coated version supports open aperture metering with the Spotmatic F, ES and ES II, and therefore might as well have been labeled SMC Takumar."

The first model has a 58 mm filter size with the optical design shown in the leftmost diagram whereas the second model has a 49 mm filter size and the optical design shown in the rightmost diagram. Also, the first model features a slightly differently designed distance scale than the second model. The final release of this lens was a Super-Multi-Coated model with improved coating but otherwise with the same optics as the second Super-Takumar model. The two versions of the first model differ as follows: The aperture of the early version goes to F22 whereas the later version bottoms out at F16. The aperture ring of the early version has fine ribs, the later one has coarse ribs. Pictured to the left is the first Super-Takumar model, early variant; in the center we show the second model of the Super-Takumar; to the right we have the Super-Multi-Coated variant.

269,description,"The 35mm F3.5 M42 screwmount lens was introduced in 1959 as an Auto-Takumar and the optical design remained unchanged all the way to a K-mount version ! The Auto-Takumar was followed by the Super-Takumar which came in three variants. Finally the 35mm F3.5 was released in a Super-Multi-Coated version. The 35mm F3.5 thus came in a total of five M42 versions plus the K-mount version! The three Super-Takumar versions can easily be distinguished from each other: First version: Smallest F-stop is F22. Second version: Smallest F-stop is F16 and the distance scale has no ""window"". Third version: The distance scale has a ""window"". The photos above are (left to right): Super-Takumar second version, Super-Takumar third version, Auto-Takumar, and Super-Multi-Coated Takumar.

271,description,"The first version of the Super Takumar 50mm F1.4 had 8 lens elements. Notice the cemented triplet with curved surfaces - very difficult and expensive to manufacture and it's said Asahi lost money on every copy sold; hence it didn't last very long. This was meant as a Planar-killer and once its crown had been awarded by the press the simplified 7/6 version was quietly ushered in (before the 8/6 crippled Asahi's finances). This 8 element version can be identified on the location of the infrared focus mark: The mark is to the right of the numeral 4 on the DOF scale. This is nicely illustrated in the second image above. This 8 element version can also be identified on the slightly protruding rear lens element and on the stop down switch, which is marked A M (rather than Auto Man as on the later versions). Also, the early version never has a dot on the aperture ring at the f/2 position whereas the later versions may or may not have a dot."

274,description,"This fast 55mm screwmount lens existed in several versions all with the same optical diagram. From the 1965 version, at least one of the glass elements is made from radioactive glass which yellows over time. While the optical diagram remained unchanged, tweaks to the optics (surface curvature, distance between elements) can't be precluded when Pentax switched glass type. Here is an overview of the variants that we're aware of: 1: Takumar 55mm F1.8 2: Auto-Takumar with semi-automatic diaphragm 3: Auto-Takumar with automatic diaphragm. The direction of the aperture ring was reversed as was the norm on early lenses 4: Auto-Takumar with automatic diaphragm. The direction of the aperture ring was reversed as was the norm on early lenses. This lens which has the Super-Takumar ""look"" except for the missing IR index mark was soon re-released as a Super-Takumar 5: Super-Takumar with fine ribs on the aperture ring and reversed direction of the aperture ring 6: Super-Takumar still with fine ribs on aperture ring, but the ring now turns the ""right"" way (has the F1.8 position to the right) as all later M42 lenses 7: Super-Takumar with coarse ribs on aperture ring 8: Super-Multi-Coated Takumar 9: SMC Takumar with open aperture metering Click here for a collage of the lens variants. 1: Takumar, the original variant: 2: Auto-Takumar, first version (4th photo above): 3: Auto-Takumar, early second version (3rd photo above). Despite the name Auto-Takumar this lens has a fully automatic diaphragm like the later Super-Takumar lenses. The aperture ring turns the opposite way compared to all later lenses: 4: Auto-Takumar, late second version. Despite the name Auto-Takumar this lens has a fully automatic diaphragm and looks like the later Super-Takumar. The aperture ring turns the opposite way compared to all later lenses: 5: Super-Takumar, first version. This version can be recognized on its fine ribs on aperture ring and that the smallest F-stop (F16) is to the right on the ring: 6: Super-Takumar, second version. This version can be recognized on its fine ribs on aperture ring and that the smallest F-stop (F16) is to the left on the ring: 7: Super-Takumar, latest version. This version has coarse ribs on aperture ring (last photo): 8: Super-Multi-Coated Takumar (1st photo above): 9: SMC Takumar (2nd photo above). This final version has a rubberized focus ring and open aperture metering with the Spotmatic F, ES and ESII:"

The first photograph is of the Preset version, the second photo of the Auto-Takumar version. The Auto-Takumar version has a semi-automatic mechanism for opening the aperture for ""bright field focusing"". This mechanism was the precursor to the true automatic mechanism employed in later lenses. While optically the same, these two lenses are very different in their exterior physical manifestations, having different weights, filter diameters and arrangements of focus and aperture rings. These lenses were superseded by a five element optical design, released in a Takumar, two Super-Takumar and a Super-Multi-Coated Takumar version.

It is identical to its D-FA series predecessor , except that its lens hood has been stretched to give better results on digital Pentax 645 bodies. As a consequence this lens will now produce vignetting on Pentax 645 film bodies, so you should go for the D-FA version if you also shoot film. This professional lens is fully weather-sealed and features silent autofocus. The Pentax DA 645 25mm lens became available in April, 2012 for $4,995 and was discontinued in mid-2015 for unknown reasons."

315,description,"This ultra-wide-angle lens has a field of view that corresponds roughly to a 13mm lens on a Pentax APS-C DSLR or a 20mm lens on a full-frame 35mm SLR. Its image circle is big enough for use with current Pentax 645 film bodies. It was launched in April, 2011 with an MSRP of $4999.95. It features all the latest technologies from Pentax, including SDM autofocus, quick-shift manual focus, super-protect and aero bright coatings, a drop-in filter slot, and 11 weather seals. It uses the Pentax 645 AF2 mount, with support for SDM focusing only. This lens was succeeded by the DA 25mm F4 ."

316,description,Extreme wide angle lens for the 645 format. This lens was introduced in 2015 and replaced its FA counterpart. It retained the optical design of the FA lens but with some tweaks of the aspherical elements and the aperture blades became rounded for a nicer bokeh. The lens elements are now HD coated for increased contrast and reduced flare and ghosting. The front element has SP coating which repels water and grease. The lens has an aperture ring which makes it fully backwards compatible with 645 film cameras. The petal-shaped bayonet lens hood has a removable piece which makes it easier to adjust a circular polarizer.

321,description,"This lens was introduced in 2010 with the PENTAX 645D camera and incorporates a high-performance, hybrid aspherical optical element in its optics. On the 645D its field of view is that of a standard lens; on a 645 film camera it will be a wide angle lens. According to PENTAX this lens offers exceptional image-resolving power with outstanding brightness levels even at the edges, while compensating various aberrations to a minimum. All lens characteristics are optimized for digital photography: for instance, flare and ghost images are minimized by applying exclusive lens coatings to optical elements and employing anti-reflection materials for the interior of the lens barrel. As the result, this lens can bring out the full potential of the PENTAX 645D medium-format digital SLR camera. The lens covers the full 645 format and can thus be used on 645 film cameras as well as on 645 digital cameras. The lens has a built-in motor (SDM) for the autofocus function. On a 645 film camera the lens can be used in manual focus mode only, and only in P and Tv exposure modes due to the lack of an aperture ring."

325,description,Normal lens in the 645 film format. In the 645 digital format it has the field of view of a short telephoto lens. The lens is manual focus only. This lens has a built-in leaf shutter which allows for high speed flash synchronization. The top speed with flash is 1/500s. The flash must be connected to the lens with an X-synch cord. The lens can also be used without the leaf shutter as an ordinary 645 lens. It has no A setting so Program and Tv exposure modes are not supported. While the lens was designed for use on Pentax 645 film cameras it will also work on the 645D and 645Z.

326,description,"The HD Pentax-D FA 645 90mm ED AW SR Macro is a short telephoto lens designed for use with PENTAX 645 digital cameras where the focal length is ideal for macro and portraiture. Pentax promises a beautiful bokeh (out-of-focus effect) thanks in part to an aperture with 9 rounded blades. The lens provides up to 0.5x magnification and incorporates two ED (extra-low dispersion) elements and one glass-molded aspherical element in its optics. The lens covers the full 645 format and can thus be used on 645 film cameras as well as on 645 digital cameras. It has built-in Shake Reduction and is weather-sealed like all other modern medium format lenses from Pentax. It was the first Pentax medium format lens to feature Pentax HD coating, which is superior to the traditional SMC. The lens has a built-in motor for the autofocus function. On a 645 film camera the lens can be used in manual focus mode only, and only in P and Tv exposure modes due to the lack of an aperture ring."

339,description,"The HD Pentax-DA 645 28-45mm F4.5 is a wide-angle zoom for digital Pentax medium format cameras, such as the 645Z and 645D. This lens features the latest Pentax lens technologies, including HD and Aero Bright (nano) coating, DC in-lens autofocus, Super Protect front element coating, and in-lens Shake Reduction. It corresponds roughly to a 22-36mm zoom on 35mm film and offers a diagonal field of view of 89-63 degrees. You may wish to consider this lens if the SMC Pentax-DA 645 25mm F4 AL [IF] SDM AW is too wide or restrictive for your needs. The US retail price is $4999. In the UK, the lens retails for 3399 pounds."

Pentax Canada says 11 elements in 9 groups whereas various other sources say 9 elements in 8 groups. The latter is supported by the one and only optical diagram PentaxForums have been able to find. If you have definite information on the optical formula please let a forum administrator know. The lens came in two variants:

395,description,"This lens is a telezoom for the Pentax Q Series of compact mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras. It's focal length range is equivalent to approximately 85 to 250 mm in the full-frame (24 x 36 mm) format when used on a Q/Q10, and 70 to 210 mm when used on a Q7. This lens is part of the Pentax-Q ""High Performance"" lens series, designed to maximize image quality, and it features two extra-low dispersion glass elements and one super-low dispersion glass element, super-protect (SP) lens coating. It has a constant aperture of F2.8 wide open and stops down to F8. To compensate for the lack of apertures smaller than F8 it has a built-in neutral density filter. The lens has a built-in shutter which prevents the rolling shutter effect and synchronizes with the built-in flash.
