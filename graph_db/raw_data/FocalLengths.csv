1,Extreme Wide-Angle,"An extreme wide-angle lens offers a very short focal length, typically ranging from 8mm to 24mm, capturing an expansive field of view. Perfect for dramatic landscapes, architecture, and interiors, this lens produces a pronounced perspective distortion, emphasizing foreground elements and creating a sense of vastness."
2,Wide-Angle,"A wide-angle lens typically ranges from 25mm to 45mm in focal length, providing a wider field of view than standard lenses. It is ideal for landscapes, architectural photography, and environmental portraits, allowing more of the scene to be captured while maintaining relatively natural proportions."
3,Normal,"A normal lens, with a focal length around 50mm (45mm to 58mm on a full-frame camera), closely mimics the human eye’s field of view. It offers a natural perspective, making it versatile for everyday photography, portraits, street scenes, and general-purpose shooting, with minimal distortion."
4,Telephoto,"A telephoto lens, generally ranging from 70mm to 200mm, allows you to photograph distant subjects with great detail. It brings far-off objects closer, making it ideal for wildlife, sports, and portrait photography, where compression of space and background blur (bokeh) can create a pleasing effect."
5,Extreme Telephoto,"An extreme telephoto lens with a focal length beyond 300mm enables photographers to capture distant subjects with incredible clarity and detail. Often used in wildlife and sports photography, it allows you to photograph subjects from a far distance, effectively compressing the scene and isolating the subject from its background."
6,Zoom,"A zoom lens offers a variable focal length, typically covering a range of focal lengths from wide-angle to telephoto (e.g., 24-70mm or 18-200mm). Its flexibility allows you to quickly adjust framing without changing lenses, making it versatile for situations where you need to quickly adapt to different compositions, such as travel or event photography."
